# Predictive Maintenance with Sensor Data

This repository contains code and resources for implementing predictive maintenance using historical sensor data. Predictive maintenance aims to forecast equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules by analyzing sensor readings and leveraging machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach to maintenance that utilizes data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling to predict when equipment failure is likely to occur. By identifying potential issues before they lead to downtime or costly repairs, organizations can minimize unplanned downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall operational efficiency.

This repository provides a Python-based implementation of a predictive maintenance workflow, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment. It demonstrates how to use machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze historical sensor data, build predictive models, and make maintenance predictions.

## Repository Structure

- `Datasets/`: Contains sample sensor data files in CSV format.
- `/`: Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various aspects of the predictive maintenance workflow.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository and instructions for usage.
